# recipe-catalog-server
NodeJS, GraphQL, Prisma

The final project can be found here: https://recipes.gregleeper19.now.sh/

For this project I used a combination of Hasura, NextJS and GraphQL to create a listing of recipes. There is an authenticated area of the site for adding your own recipes to the list including pictures. The storage for pictures is AWS S3.
